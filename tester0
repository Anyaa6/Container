VECTOR ITERATORS - begin, end, rbegin, rend
last - 1 : 0
index_test begin 42
Testing begin front end back
index_test begin 42
index_test begin 12
index_test begin 12
Testing random_access_iterators
The different iterators are equal to :
it == it2
it3 = ++begin()
it4 = begin()++

(it == it2) :true
(it != it2) :false
(it <= it2) :true
(it >= it2) :true
it < it2 :false
it < it3 :true
(it > it2) :false

Printing values with index []: 
it[0] = 12
it[1] = 12
it[2] = 12
it[3] = 12
changing second value to 52 from iterator *it3 = 52
Printing values with iterators *it : 
it = 12
it = 52
it = 12
it = 12
Printing values with iterators *it from the end : 
it = 12
it = 12
it = 52
it = 12
it + 1 = 52
it + 1 + 1 = 12
itoffset = 1 + hehe.begin() = 52
diff between itoffset - begin() = 1
